# Final project
Thanks for your interests in our project - *Sentiments' Effect on Different Game Experiences*

This project aims at knowing more about video game in general. It examines the relationship between *sentiments* existed in video game's product consumptive experience, which is examined through online game reviews, and its product evaluation score, a general indicator of *product satisfaction*, and the moderating role of *game experiential categories*.

1. To access the final report  
Please go to https://uc-cfss.github.io/fp-ChihYuChiang/index.html. Note that there are several pages under construction and we would possibly update them in the next 24 hrs.

1. To reproduce analysis  
Due to the size of our data, we are not able to upload it onto github space. Please download the entire "data" folder from https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmWWAiIF8N_Eg6ZGbGXbvVBzp5jvLQ and put it in the root directory (where README.md exists). Next, run from 02 to 05 .R files in the folder "bin", orderly. Note this skip the very first step of producing the df from raw data we collected online. That means you have to make sure there are .csv files in the "data" folder for you to perform analysis.

1. To reproduce the data extraction and combination efforts  
The raw html files are quite large in size and can be provided by request. The raw data should be put in a folder named "raw" directly under data folder. With the raw html files, you will be able to reproduce the aforementioned process by executing number 01 Python code in the folder "bin", and create your own .csv files.

1. To Scrape the data by yourself  
The code is also provided in the number 01 Python file within the folder "bin". As for further instruction of using it, please contact us.
